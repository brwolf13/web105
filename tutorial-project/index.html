    <p>Many of us grew up using dial-up internet. A short video would take hours to download and websites loaded a little bit at a time.
        Do you remember the first time you used a broadband connection after using the internet for years on dial-up?
        For me, upgrading my first PC from a standard hard drive to solid state storage was one of the biggest speed
        leaps I've seen since then.

    <p>In this guide I will detail what you will need to do this, how long it will take, and give a basic overview of how to do it. Good luck!
