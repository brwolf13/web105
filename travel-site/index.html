            <h2>The Keys</h2>
            <p>The Florida Keys are a string of islands off the coast of Florida. Highway 1, also known as the <q>Overseas Highway</q> connects most of the popular islands. Depending on which keys you want to visit, it may be best to fly into Miami and drive from there, or it may be easier to fly into Key West.</p>
            <p>Key West is the most popular destination in the keys. Many will fly directly there without stopping at the Florida mainland. It is an extremely relaxing vacation spot which is why it is so popular.</p>

        <p>In addition to its many attractions, Florida is a common vacation destination for Chicagoans in particular because of how inexpensive it can be to travel there. If you find the right deal, round-trip flights to Miami and Fort Myers can be had for just over $100 each.</p>
        <p>Due to the climate and ease/relative cheap cost of transport, many people from Illinois either purchase vacation homes in Florida and/or ultimately move to Flordia post-retirement. Property taxes in Florida are much cheaper than in Illinois which makes having vacation property there that much more reasonable.</p>
        <p>Overall - if you like a warm climate and the smell of the ocean, Florida may be the place for you. Be sure to visit soon!</p>
