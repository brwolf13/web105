            <h2>Coastal Islands</h2>
            <p>While most are aware that Rhode Island is the smallest state in the US, many do not know that there are numerous small islands right off its coast.</p>
            <p>Anyone visiting the state should make it a point to visit Aquidneck Island at the least. Aside from the beautiful beaches and rich architecture, it is home to Newport - one of the most historical and prominient cities on the coast.</p>

        <h2>Rhode Island</h2>
        <p>While not a common answer to a request for someone's favorite vacation spots - Rhode Island is a beautiful place to see and should be considered more often.</p>
        <p>Despite its size (the smallest state in the US!), it has quite a bit to offer. A nearly perfect summer climate and easy access to the ocean are just the start. Rhode Island is filled with historical architecture and beautiful must-see cities.</p>

        <p>Any nature lover will find Rhode Island a great place to explore. More than half of the state is still forested, meaning plenty of unspoiled territory for wildlife observation. If you like birds take a visit to Block Island, where over 70 species of rare birds stop to rest during their migration.</p>
        <p>Rhode island is a wonderful little state filled with nature and history. Anyone looking for a vacation with more outdoor time and less resorts would have a wonderful time there.</p>
